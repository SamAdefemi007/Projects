# Projects

Hello and welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, I present a collection of projects that showcase my skills, proficiency, and experience as a senior software developer. Each project is carefully chosen to demonstrate a unique aspect of software development.

For each project, you'll find a brief description, the tech stack used, a link to the live demo (if available), and a link to its individual GitHub repository.

Let's dive in!
